Telar is a study about weaving.

Weaving is one of the oldest crafts in the world. It's been part of our history for almost 30,000 years. 

We are used as species to continuously see patterns generated by millions of binary decisions between colors. These patterns are part of the social DNA of almost every human culture, and their complex aesthetics generated by the most simple inputs are fascinating to me.

This piece, inspired by the mechanism of the Jacquard Loom that is the first computer, uses combinations of colors, series, threading, treadling, and tie-up patterns to generate a unique 360x360 threads Telar ("loom" in Spanish). 

The algorithm called telar.js uses the hash to select some colors from preselected patterns, and uses the input series to generate a base model with a starting pattern. After that, multiple iterations alter the model appending new tie-ups and altering the threading or treadling and colors while keeping the design consistent. A resulting matrix containing each one of the intersections then gets drawn on the screen resulting in a high-definition image the viewer can zoom in and see in detail.
